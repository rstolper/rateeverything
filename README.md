Rate Everything application

Sometimes up at: http://diy-rateeverything.rhcloud.com/
That host shuts the application down after 24hr of inactivity, so if you get a timeout error try reloading again, the timeout may be due to OpenShift bringing the server back up.
There is currently no authentication, pick a username and stick with it.
